# Frequently Asked Questions

## How long will the mentorship be?
Typically, mentorships with me last anywhere from 8-12 weeks. I like to tell mentees that mentorships last `8 +/- O(weeks)`, as I have a lot of flexibility with deadlines. Things do come up on your end and my end that require shuffling things around. That being said, the sooner your project finishes the sooner you'll be able to maximizes your chances of getting a job offer.

## How much will the mentorship cost me?
See the SharpestMinds FAQ [here](https://www.sharpestminds.com/faq) for general details. The _typical_ rate mentors, including myself, charge is 5% of your first year's salary once you get a data science-related job. On top of that, the admins take about another 3-4% (see the ISA for details) for operating costs. This means something like ~8-9% of your first year's salary. This is generally paid monthly, starting your 2nd or 3rd month after your new job.

Example: Suppose you get a related job at the end of the mentorship making $120,000 per year in base salary. Then your gross income is $10,000 per month, of which you would pay ~$800-900 per month to SharpestMinds for your first 12 months, of which I'd personally get ~$500 per month.

Note neither I nor SharpestMinds have any interest in screwing you. I deliberately offer the typical mentor rate of 5% for precisely this reason. I want to keep rates fair and on par with what others are doing, which is fair to me and fair to you.

## Does it matter where I'm located?
For the purposes of the mentorship you can work anywhere you like so long as you have a decent internet connection. We will meet remotely via Zoom about once a week, and communicate often via Slack or email.

As far as job and networking purposes go: I understand if you have geographic limitations on where you want to work, for personal reasons or whatever, and I will try to accomodate. That being said, I strongly encourage you to keep an open mind about where your job is located. Data science jobs do tend to be highly concentrated in a few big cities still (SF Bay Area, New York, Seattle, Boston, and Toronto especially), so your odds of getting a job will be *much* better if you're flexibile on location. Note that my own personal network is best in the SF Bay Area, but I'll try my best to accomodate. You will also have access to the growing SharpestMinds network, which has a strong presence in many of the above cities mentioned (especially the Bay Area and Toronto).

## When will I get a job?
This is a tough one to answer, as it depends a lot on you and your motivations, as well as a significant luck factor. Typically, I like to target mentees getting a job within 6 months of the end of the mentorship. This is because the skills you learn in the mentorship have a shelf life. Data science is a fast-evolving field. Skills change. Needs change. Also, your interview skills atrophy quickly if you're not actively job hunting, and your networks become less valuable with time. For this reason, *I only am interested in mentees who are interested in getting a job within 6 months of the end of the mentorship*. If you plan to take longer, please wait until you're ready before applying.

## Why are mentorships based around a project?
Doing an end-to-end data science project serves several purposes:
- It's an insurance to me that you know the practical skills needed to do industry data science work, which makes me comfortable about recommending you.
- It teaches you valuable, practical skills that you'll need on the job, most of which aren't taught in school.
- It's a signal to recruiters and hiring managers that you've done something worth mentioning, which helps get them interested in you.

Please note that the project is (mostly) necessary, but *not* sufficient to get you a job. On top of a good project, you need to be able to market it effectively to your network, and sharpen your interview skills (which is almost completely unrelated to the skills you learn from the project).

## What types of roles do you mentor for?
I like to mentor people who are specifically interested in data science positions. Such positions may include: data scientist, machine learning engineer, machine learning researcher, applied scientist, natural language processing engineer, or computer vision engineer.

Note I am not the right mentor for you if you are mainly interested in other data-related positions, e.g. data engineer, database engineer, dev-ops engineer, or business analyst. If you aren't interested in data-related positions *at all* the SharpestMinds program is probably not for you (e.g. if you're interested in being a front-end or web developer).

All that said, you should know roughly what each of these position titles mean. If not, I highly encourage you to google them before hand so you know what you're getting yourself into. This [report](https://workera.ai/candidates/report/) may help you understand data science roles better.

## What type of projects do your mentees work on?
I'm willing to advise mentees on a broad range of data science projects. Anything involving analyzing and building tools around: tabular data (SQL), text (NLP), images or video (computer vision), speech, time series, etc. I do strongly prefer that projects have a large machine learning component to them.

Some of my past mentees have worked on applications involving:
- Translating Russian handwritten text to English using OCR and NLP
- Estimating the size distribution of electron microscopy imaged particles using computer vision
- Predicting student graduation success using time series methods

If you have an idea that seems vaguely data science related, let's talk about it. As long as we both think you can complete the project in a couple months or so, and you can find the data needed to do the project, I'm very flexible.

Warning: There is a lot of interest among mentees in doing computer vision related projects (e.g. image classification). This I think is because of the perceived _cool_ factor involved in these applications. Please note that computer vision is in many ways very different from other fields of data science, so if you choose to work on a CV project you may make it *harder* for you to get a data science job that isn't CV-related (which is most data science jobs). If you want to pick a _safe_ project, stuff involving tabular and text data is often a good bet, as those have a much larger market.

## What will I learn from the project?
Past mentorships with me have covered many of the things listed below. Note some of these can vary across mentee motivation and project types.
- Version control and git
- Data wrangling and feature engineering with tabular data, images, text, or sound
- Software engineering best practices
- Unit testing
- Docker and containerization
- Service oriented architectures and REST APIs
- Basic DevOps and cloud management
- Object-Oriented Programming in Python
- Setting up an end-to-end ML pipeline for production
- Code documentation best practices
- State of the art ML in your project domain
- Continuous Integration tools
- How to create Python packages that are pip installable
- Just enough full-stack development and marketing skills to show off your project to your peers

## What else will I learn during the mentorship?
On top of learning how to build an end-to-end working data science tool in your project, you will learn:
- How to network effectively in the data science community
- How to apply for jobs in a way that maximizes your odds of an interview
- How to answer interview questions for data science and software-related positions.

## I like what I've read and am interested in discussing a mentorship with you. How can I do this?
Send me an email at `rkinger@g.clemson.edu`. This is my personal email. You can also message me directly in the SharpestMinds app, though I check it much less frequently. You can also reach out to me via LinkedIn [here](www.linkedin.com/in/rkinery).

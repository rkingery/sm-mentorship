# Mentorship Info

This page contains info related to my mentorship role in the SharpestMinds program. It is mainly written for current mentees and people interested in becoming a future mentee of mine. For more general info on mentorships, like what they are and how they work, see [here](https://www.sharpestminds.com/).

For those interested in becoming a future mentee, see the `questions.md` page to get many of your questions answered. You can also reach out to me directly at my personal email: `rkinger@g.clemson.edu`.

For current mentees, please message me either via email or Slack for any questions or concerns you have.

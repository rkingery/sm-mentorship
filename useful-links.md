## Videos and Courses
- Do not pay for any of these courses! The certifications are mostly worthless and not worth paying for. Just audit the courses.
- At a minimum you should go through all the courses and videos highlighted in bold, making sure to do any coding exercises where given.
- I generally require that mentees take all of the **bolded courses** below. The rest are optional.
- Coursera: Andrew Ng has several useful MOOCs on Coursera that teach ML with a first-principles / bottom-up approach.
    - Machine Learning (ARCHIVED): https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
        - Note the course examples use Matlab instead of Python. See [here](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments) for the same assignments converted to Jupyter Notebooks. You can even submit assignments as notebooks here!
    - **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification:** https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
    - **Advanced Learning Algorithms:** https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms
    - **Unsupervised Learning**, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning: https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning
        - I encourage mentees to at least go through the section on clustering, as that may come up in ML interviews. The sections on recommender systems and reinforcement learning are more tangential and completely optional.
    - **Neural Networks and Deep Learning:** https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning
    - **Improving Deep Neural Networks:** https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning
    - Structuring Machine Learning Projects: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning
    - Convolutional Neural Networks: https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning
        - Required for mentees doing computer vision or audio projects.
    - Sequence Models: https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models
        - Required for mentees doing NLP or audio projects.
    - Classification Vector Spaces in NLP: https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp
        - Perhaps useful for people trying to break into NLP jobs. There are several follow-ons to this course as well.
- Fastai: These are very good for learning state of the art ML quickly, from top-down / applied point of view. The bolded ones are most useful.

## Interview Prep
- Note that you don't have to pay for interview prep. If something is not free, you're free to go somewhere else. The paid courses listed are perhaps more efficient in structuring prep, but are by no means required or encouraged.
- If a solution isn't free, you can almost always google the exact same question and find a place with an answer for free.
- Coding interview prep. For data science positions, focus mostly on the easy to medium difficulty array/string/hash-table/dictionary problems.

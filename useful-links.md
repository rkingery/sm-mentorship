## Videos and Courses
- Do not pay for any of these courses! The certifications are mostly worthless and not worth paying for. Just audit the courses.
- At a minimum you should go through all the courses and videos highlighted in bold, making sure to do any coding exercises where given.
- Coursera: Andrew Ng has several useful MOOCs on Coursera that teach ML with a first-principles / bottom-up approach. The bolded ones are most useful.
    - *Intro to Machine Learning:* https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
        - Note the course examples use Matlab instead of Python. See [here](https://github.com/jellis18/ML-Course-Solutions) for the same assignments converted to Jupyter Notebooks.
    - *Neural Networks and Deep Learning:* https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning
    - *Improving Deep Neural Networks:* https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning
    - Structuring Machine Learning Projects: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning
    - Convolutional Neural Networks: https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning
        - Most useful for those doing computer vision projects.
    - Sequence Models: https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models
        - Most useful for those doing NLP or time series projects.
- Fastai: These are very good for learning state of the art ML quickly, from top-down / applied point of view. The bolded ones are most useful.
    - *Classical Machine Learning:* http://course18.fast.ai/ml
    - *Deep Learning 1:* http://course.fast.ai/
    - Deep Learning 2: https://course.fast.ai/part2
    - Classical NLP: https://www.fast.ai/2019/07/08/fastai-nlp/
    - Computational Linear Algebra: https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra/blob/master/README.md

# Mentorship Expectations

- Decide on a project quickly. This is what the whole mentorship will be based around. At most you should have this decided within one week of the mentorship start date. We will discuss project ideas, but you should choose something that (1) you find interesting and will keep you motivated to finish, and (2) is feasible to complete end-to-end in about 8-12 weeks.

- Depending on how much background you have in ML, start going through Andrew Ng's ML Course (see my useful links page). I will expect you to be completely finished with this course by the end of week 2 of the mentorship!

- Depending on how much background you have with coding, algorithms, and python, start going through the MIT Intro to CS Part 1 course (see my useful links page). I will expect you to be completely finished with this course by the end of week 4 of the mentorship!

- Barring rare exceptions, projects will be done in Python 3. It is assumed that you already have some experience coding in Python. It is also assumed that you can work with both Python script editors/IDEs (e.g. VSCode, Sublime, PyCharm), and with Jupyter Notebooks.

- If you don't already have a github account, create one. Create a new repository for your project and add me as a contributor. My username is _rkingery_. All code for the project *must* be done inside this repository, and will be expected to be version controlled using `git`. All edits must be made via branches to master, and merges can be made to master only by opening a pull request and having me code review and approve the request first. We will discuss this in some depth. Good version control is *essential* to modern data science and software engineering.

- If you're already applying for data science or ML jobs, decrease the frequency for now. We'll ramp this back up towards the end of the mentorship. The only ones you want to apply to are low-risk jobs that you don't care much about, so that you can practice your interview skills with little lost from doing so.

- We will meet in person once a week via Zoom for about an hour. The goal of this meeting will be to discuss your project work. In particular, to review what you've accomplished so far, clear up any blockers or questions you have, and set goals for the next week. These "goals" and their status will be kept track of using an informal Scrum approach, either in an Excel spreadsheet or on AirTable or Trello.

- On top of this, you will send me updates every couple days on Slack describing what you worked on those two days along with what you will be working on the next two days. This will be our light equivalent of Scrum "daily standups".

- Be prepared to allocate at least 10-20 hours per week on your project. Towards the latter half of the mentorship, be prepared to allocate an additional 5-10 hours per week to job application and interview prep. Unless otherwise specified, assume the mentorship will last approximately 2 months.

- If you can't make a meeting or fulfill your goal for a sprint, you should let me know ASAP. The sooner you let me know, the sooner we can work something out. I assume you will be professional in your obligations and treat this as you would your dream job. I'll make my best efforts to do the same.
